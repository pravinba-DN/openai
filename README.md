## Projects

### 1. **Language Tutor with Streamlit** üìöüó£Ô∏è


Welcome to the **Language Tutor** project! This demo application leverages **OpenAI's LLM APIs** to provide an interactive, AI-powered language learning experience. Built with **Streamlit**, this project serves as a basic prototype for a multi-functional language tutoring platform.

The app supports various modes of tutoring, helping users learn languages through **image captioning**, **text-to-text translation**, and **speech-to-text translation**. The user interface is simple, designed for demo purposes, but the functionality demonstrates how large language models can be applied to diverse educational tasks.

## Features üéì

### 1. **Image Captioning** üñºÔ∏è‚ú®
- Users can upload images, and the AI will generate a description of the image in natural language.
- **Use case**: Helps in building vocabulary by associating images with their textual descriptions.

### 2. **Text to Text Language Translation** üåêüî§
- Translate text from one language to another using the power of OpenAI's translation models.
- **Supported Languages**: English, Spanish, French, German, and more.
- **Use case**: Instant language translation to aid in learning new languages.

### 3. **Speech to Text Translation** üé§‚û°Ô∏èüìù
- Convert spoken language into text and then translate it to a target language.
- **Use case**: Ideal for practicing pronunciation and learning how to transcribe and translate spoken language.

### 4. **OpenAI LLM Integration** ü§ñüí¨
- Built on OpenAI's powerful language models, the app leverages their capabilities to understand and generate human-like text responses.
- **Use case**: Engages learners in a realistic and interactive tutoring environment.

## Demo Walkthrough üöÄ
